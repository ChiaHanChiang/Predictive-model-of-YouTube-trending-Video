# Predictive-model-of-YouTube-trending-Video

## Problem Setting 
The YouTube platform has two kinds of users - the ones that post videos and others that view them. Videos are always posted under a parent channel. YouTube channels, aim to acquire a large enough fan base so that they can make their own channel a profit-making marketing business. In order to determine if a YouTube channel should be paid for marketing a product there are metrics that can support when a video is said to have successfully acquired an audience. 

## Problem definition 
The goal of this project is to explore data mining techniques to create a reliable predictive model that can foresee YouTube video trendiness given that a video has already shown up on the platform’s top trending list, once. Trendiness across all videos is measured by the frequency in which a video is displayed on the trending list. The videos that are captured on the “trending list” do not necessarily consist of the most viewed, liked or commented on videos. For a video to be selected on the top trending list, a combination of factors are taken into consideration.
